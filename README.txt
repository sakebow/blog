This is a tutorial contains something not so difficult about javascript, java, C#, C and C++.
Maybe you are or had ever been trapped in these problems.
I was also trapped, so I would like to write some tutorials for those who are still stumped.

These are what I use:
    HBuilder8.8.4
	Eclipse neon
    Visual Studio 2017 Professional - only install ASP part, 8G in total.

If I use new softwares for further blog pages, I'll update and emphasize them with highlight.

 * infomation about current version
Updated 2019/2/19:
    "javascript" part is completed.
	Maybe you will be confused because it seems I forgot to upload some tutorials about the interaction between background and front-end using ajax.

    Sorry for everyone, as for the crazy course design and the Postgraduate examination, I have to pause this blog pages for a short time.
    Maybe I'll be back later, or maybe I'll update it once a week.
    However, you may relax because personal blogs are better for job hunting in the future, thus leading me to perfect this blog until there's actually nothing to spare in the blog.
